## Ideas
- Model abundance patterns in the Milky Way as a combination of Galactocentric radius (or, better, actions) and irrelevant "housekeeping" data.
- Exploit causal-structure beliefs to improve abundance measurements *post facto*.
- Start with *SDSS-IV APOGEE* because it has a large footprint in Galactic coordinates, and it has two different spectrographs (and issues with fiber number and so on).
